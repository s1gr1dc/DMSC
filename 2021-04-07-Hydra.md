## Live Coding with Hydra 


In coding with Hydra, I found the actiovity more captivating than usually other code or language. I think a big part of this is being able to see what is happening directly behind the code and as I code as well, in contrast with P5.js and other editors. I found that it was fairly simple to understand and it also was really enjoyable to expirement with. I particularly enjoyed using the pixelate effect especially when combined with noise.

In this screenshot I was playing around with pixelate as well as the colorama feature, in the next 2 images I experimentted with repeating shapes and blurring the edges while adding color in the oscilation. The colors in the oscillation were especially nice in the second image, the code was allowing for the colors to pass through smoothly and slowly which I liked more, rather than the first.

In these last 3 images, I continued the use of the pixelate effect and combined it with noise and colorama. I most pleased with the end result where I had the noise speed set to .3, the pixelated colorful blobs moved in and out of the frame, sometimes taking up the entire screen and then leaving the screen completely to where all you could see was black for a few seconds until it returned.
