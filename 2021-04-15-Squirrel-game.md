In this sketch, I used different colors and sized and ellipses, taking away the stroke so that the shapes could blend together and create a squirrel figure for the game. I used the same shapes for the Evil squirrel, adding a brown circle in between the red eyes to make it look angry. We used the coded squirrels in our final code, but exported them as image files to simplify the process.

In this second sketch, I implemented a crunch sound which I downloaded from Freesound and edited to be cleaner, into the first stage or rough draft of our combined code.

We then using the same images and sounds, and combined all the code collectively to produce our final output.
