## Squirrel Game



In this sketch, I used different colors and sized and ellipses, taking away the stroke so that the shapes could blend together and create a squirrel figure for the game. I used the same shapes for the Evil squirrel, adding a brown circle in between the red eyes to make it look angry. We used the coded squirrels in our final code, but exported them as image files to simplify the process.

In this second sketch, I implemented a crunch sound which I downloaded from Freesound and edited to be cleaner, into the first stage or rough draft of our combined code.

We then used all of our seperate works andd combined all the code collectively to produce our final output.

Overall I really enjoyed the experience of working on something like this with my classmates. I'm really passionate in making my own figures and objects using shapes in things like p5.js or processing, and I felt conifdent in being able to provide these visuals for my group. Although I felt that I wasn't as skilled as Ishan and Sofia, in other aspects, being able to meet with them, view their code and processes as well as collaborate was deffinitely valuable.
