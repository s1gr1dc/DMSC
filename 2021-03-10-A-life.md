Emergence and Spore 

Emergence in A-life and A.I. terms can be best described as providing a guide structure to the artificial life. Spore Creature Creator game, is a good exapmle of emergence because as you play the game the output or outcome as it grows, grows also in complexity regarding the choices you make for your creature. Examples of this would be whether the animal eats meat or is vegetarian, or whether the animal chooses to socialize or be hostile toward other animal groups. Regarding whichever choices made the game progresses and you see the pros and cons of the choice made in the next step of evolution for your creature. I think that my array of creatures demonstrates emergence through the randomness functions in the color as well as varying speeds.
