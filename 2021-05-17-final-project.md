DMSC Final project 

For my final project, I created a 4 level circus themed obstacle game, that uses keys to navigate a small character through passing objects to reach the top of the screen. The game begins with an obstacle of balloons that are being generated at random height and width within the canvas passing from left to right, and a small clown character that represents the player. The object of the game is to move upwards through the passing objects to reach the next level. When the next level is reached the visuals of the game change, as well the background music and what the passing objects are. Along with the change in visuals and ambience, the clown having to navigate through the passing object increases in size with each level change, making each level more difficult than the last. If you can pass the last level, it brings you back to level 1 and restores the size of the player. Since the passing objects are generated randomly each time it runs, the game can sometimes be really easy but other times it can be super challenging to advance. I reccommend trying to playthrough until the end more than once to see what I mean.

 After the completion of the Squirrel-eat-squirrel game with my classmates, I knew that I wanted my final project to be game-like. At first, I aimed for the concept of game to be more of a character interaction based game where there would be objects and other creatures and characters to "talk to" or interact with. However, as the making of my game progressed, I really felt that I could still achieve the main structural goals and themes I had while taking a more engaging route. I was really beggining to gravitate towards a level based game with genuine challenges, I feel that part of the reason that I wanted to take th eproject in this direction was because I had made an character based interaction walk-through like game already in the past. 

The biggest challenge that I faced in the creation of my project was trying to combine simple room to room mechanics with an obstacle. I was able to create both seperatley, combining them was a little more challenging then I had thought it would be. At first, I was using buttons as a gateway and environment changing intitator, that would only appear when the character reached the top. However, buttons that called fucntions outside of draw, didn't work with the way that I was trying to operate the game. Instead I used arrays for each background music, background image, and object image. I had a small hiccup with the songs overlapping, but I used a few if statements in the class of the Clown to make sure depending on which level the charcter was in that the last song stopped playing and the new one began. If I were to further add to this project, it would be cool to be able to combine a level based game with interaction with other characters, and more smaller sounds and text as well. Overall, I am really satisfied with how the project turned out, I feel that it still checked all my boxes even though I went in a slightly different direction that originally planned.
